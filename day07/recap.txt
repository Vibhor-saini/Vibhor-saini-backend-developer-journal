ðŸ”¹ 1. Difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?
âœ… Checked Exception: Checked at compile time (e.g., IOException, SQLException).
âœ… Unchecked Exception: Occurs at runtime, not checked by compiler (e.g., NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException).

ðŸ”¹ 2. Difference between throw and throws?
throw â†’ Used inside a method to actually throw an exception.
throws â†’ Declares that a method may throw one or more exceptions.

ðŸ”¹ 3. What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize()?
final â†’ keyword to make a variable constant, prevent method overriding, or class inheritance.
finally â†’ block that always executes (even if exception occurs).
finalize() â†’ method called by Garbage Collector before object is destroyed.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Can we have a try block without a catch block?
ðŸ‘‰ Yes, but only if you use a finally block with it.
Example:

try {
    // risky code
} finally {
    // cleanup
}

ðŸ”¹ 5. What happens if an exception is not handled?
ðŸ‘‰ The program terminates abruptly, and the JVM prints a stack trace.


throw â†’ actually throws error (always).
throws â†’ just declares possibility (maybe).

âš¡ Bonus:
Q. Can a finally block be skipped?
ðŸ‘‰ Yes, if you call System.exit(0) inside try or catch like: readFile(); [if file not exist then error]
